### Cristina
My name is Cristina and I am en exchange student from Milan in Italy where I am studying Business Analytics and Big Data at Politecnico di Milano.

The things that I am passionate about are:

* Sports: Volleyball, Skii, Surf, Wakeboard and Pole Dance
* Art: I love reading about art and going to exibitions, expecially about Contemporary Art
* Music: I listen to Rock, Indie-rock and Electronic music and I love going to concerts and festivals
* Travel: I like to discover new culture and meet new people

A **fun fact** about me is that I am super clumpsy, I can drop everything that I am holding and I hit everything that is around me. So don't ask me to hold your phone or to take care of something precious if you don't want it totally smashed :D

I mean that I have to change my approach, look at the world from a different perspective, with a different logic and with fresh methods of cognition and verification."

I'll say yes to anything you offer me to do but I am particularly fond of

* Theatre 
* Running 
* Classical music
    - Brams
    - Litz
    - Beethoven
* Tennis 
 

I am also very good at learning new languages and therefore enjoy to learn new ones. 

A **fun fact** about me is that my grandpa has written an encyclopedia of 18 
volumes about the European litterature.
